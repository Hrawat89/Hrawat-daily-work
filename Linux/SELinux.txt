In Red Hat Enterprise Linux, you can set individual domains to permissive mode while the system runs in enforcing mode. For example, to make the httpd_t domain permissive:

# semanage permissive   # semanage permissive -a httpd_t


he fixfiles -F onboot command is used to schedule a filesystem relabeling for the next boot. This is particularly useful when you need to ensure 
that the SELinux security contexts are correctly set for all files and directories on your system. Hereâ€™s how you can use it


#!/bin/bash

echo "Starting full filesystem relabeling with fixfiles..."

sudo fixfiles -F relabel

echo "Filesystem relabeling complete. Rebooting the system..."
reboot


#!/bin/bash

echo "Starting partial filesystem relabeling for /var/www..."

sudo restorecon -Rv /var/www

echo "Partial relabeling complete."

Managing confined and unconfined users
---------------------------------
determine the current state of these booleans   $semanage boolean -l
To list all SELinux users, their SELinux roles, and levels and ranges for MLS and MCS, use the $semanage user -l command as root.
